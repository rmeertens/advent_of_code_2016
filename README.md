# Advent of Code 2016

2016 was the first year I did advent of code. I was pretty new to algorithms and data structures, but I figured it would be a nice way to test my strenghts. Unfortunately I tested my strenghts in random files spread out over many folders, and I can only find a few files back from this period. 

Luckily I did write a blogpost to describe my approaches: http://www.pinchofintelligence.com/advent-of-codetesting-2016/. 

Please forgive me my terrible code, and the lack of it.
